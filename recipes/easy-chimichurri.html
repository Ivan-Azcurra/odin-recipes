    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I took elements of several chimichurri recipes I found to come up with
      this combination, which has become a favorite. Can be stored for up to 2
      weeks in the refrigerator.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup tightly packed chopped parsley leaves</li>
      <li>1 cup tightly packed chopped cilantro leaves</li>
      <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>½ onion, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine parsley, cilantro, red wine vinegar, onion, garlic, salt,
        oregano, hot pepper flakes, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor;
        pulse a few times. Pour olive oil in slowly, while pulsing a few more
        times, until chimichurri is chopped, but not mushy.
      </li>
      <li>Refrigerate until flavors have blended, about 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
