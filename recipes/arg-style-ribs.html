    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These Argentinian-style short ribs are heavily coated with salt to bring
      out the fat. At first glance, you'll say "Whoa, that's way too salty!" But
      give them a try! This quick and easy recipe is one of the best I've ever
      tried.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 pounds beef short ribs</li>
      <li>1 cup coarse salt, or as needed</li>
      <li>6 medium limes, cut in wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>Coat ribs heavily with salt.</li>
      <li>
        Cook on the preheated grill until meat pulls away easily from the bone,
        5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
        center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer ribs to a large glass serving dish and squeeze lime wedges over
        top. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
